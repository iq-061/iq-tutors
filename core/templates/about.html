      <h1 class="about-title">Teaching Structure</h1>
      <h2 class = "about-subtitle">Lessons</h2>
      <p class = "about-text">
        Lessons will take place at the agreed upon time every week, either in person or online. Lessons for
        a typical course will occur at least once a week. Each lesson is typically 2 hours in length, unless
        explicitly stated otherwise. The timing of lessons each week is dependent solely on the plan proposed in the
        initial consultation meeting, and is subject (but unlikely) to change after the free induction lesson.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "about-subtitle">Homework</h2>
      <p class = "about-text">
        Homework will be set after every lesson, and due for the lesson after. Students are expected to complete all assigned
        homework before every lesson, and bring it with them when they attend (or upload it to the required area). It will usually
        consist of tasks consolidating the learning done in the lesson, and preparation for any content to be covered in the subsequent one.
        Completion of homework is key in order to achieve the desired results, so please bear this in mind!
      </p>
      <h2 class = "about-subtitle">Pupil Safety</h2>
      <p class = "about-text">
        The safety of children we teach is of utmost importance. Our tutors are DBS checked, and we spot-check lessons
        using recordings in order to prevent misconduct. Children strictly should not give out any personal details to tutors such as
        emails or phone numbers, even if this is for academic purposes (e.g. homework help). The facilities for this will already be in place
        elsewhere. We ask parents to emphasise this with the child.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "about-subtitle">Portal</h2>
      <p class = "about-text">
        Log-in credentials will become available when the student enrols into a course.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "about-subtitle">Payments</h2>
      <p class = "about-text">
        Lessons are paid for on a pay-as-you go basis, with payment due at the end of each month into the specified account. Parents will be reminded of the amount due
        and number of lessons in a month may vary, so standing orders are discouraged. Courses will typically require an initial deposit, at the cost
        of one lesson. Induction lessons are free of charge.

      <h1 class="about-title">About Us</h1>

      <p class="about-text">
        We are a small, close-knit team of dedicated tutors who genuinely love teaching.
        We believe that strong academic outcomes come from clear explanations, patience, and
        a real understanding of how students learn — not rushed lessons or generic approaches.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Our tutors have been teaching for years, working with students across a wide range of
        abilities and backgrounds. Whether a student needs support building confidence,
        strengthening foundations, or pushing towards top grades, we take the time to understand
        their needs and adapt our teaching accordingly.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Because we are a small team, we are able to maintain high standards across every lesson.
        Tutors are carefully selected not only for their subject knowledge, but also for their
        ability to explain concepts clearly, motivate students, and create a calm, supportive
        learning environment. Reliability, professionalism, and consistency are central to how
        we operate.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        We place a strong emphasis on structured learning, regular feedback, and exam awareness.
        Lessons are designed to be engaging and purposeful, while homework is focused and
        manageable — reinforcing learning without overwhelming students. Over time, this approach
        helps students become more confident, independent learners.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Here at IQ Tutors, teaching is not treated as a side activity — it is something we care deeply
        about. We take pride in seeing students grow academically and personally, and we are
        committed to supporting them throughout their journey from early secondary school through
        to GCSE success.
