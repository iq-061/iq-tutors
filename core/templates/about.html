      <h1 class="about-title">About Us</h1>

      <p class="about-text">
        We are a small, close-knit team of dedicated tutors who genuinely love teaching.
        We believe that strong academic outcomes come from clear explanations, patience, and
        a real understanding of how students learn — not rushed lessons or generic approaches.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Our tutors have been teaching for years, working with students across a wide range of
        abilities and backgrounds. Whether a student needs support building confidence,
        strengthening foundations, or pushing towards top grades, we take the time to understand
        their needs and adapt our teaching accordingly.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Because we are a small team, we are able to maintain high standards across every lesson.
        Tutors are carefully selected not only for their subject knowledge, but also for their
        ability to explain concepts clearly, motivate students, and create a calm, supportive
        learning environment. Reliability, professionalism, and consistency are central to how
        we operate.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        We place a strong emphasis on structured learning, regular feedback, and exam awareness.
        Lessons are designed to be engaging and purposeful, while homework is focused and
        manageable — reinforcing learning without overwhelming students. Over time, this approach
        helps students become more confident, independent learners.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Here at IQ Tutors, teaching is not treated as a side activity — it is something we care deeply
        about. We take pride in seeing students grow academically and personally, and we are
        committed to supporting them throughout their journey from early secondary school through
        to GCSE success.
